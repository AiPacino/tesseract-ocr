# Introduction #

Tesseract is extremely flexible, if you know how to control it. There is a large number of control parameters to modify its behaviour. While these change from time to time, most of them are fairly stable.

There are 3 different types:

### Init only ###
Characterized by **INIT** in its initialization macro.
These parameters can **only** be set at the ` TessBaseAPI::Init ` function that takes a list of config files.

The rest can be set through ` TessBaseAPI::SetVariable ` and make 2 further groups:

### General parameters: ###
Control many different aspects of Tesseract's functionality.

### Debug parameters: ###
Contain debug in their name, control huge amounts of optional debug text and graphical output as Tesseract works.


# Useful parameters #

Note that the default value may change; check the source code if you need to be sure of it.

| **Name** | **Type** | **Default value** | **Init only** | **Description** |
|:---------|:---------|:------------------|:--------------|:----------------|
| ` load_system_dawg ` | boolean (0/1) | 1 | Yes | Controls whether or not to load the main dictionary for the selected language. |
| ` user_words_suffix ` | string | "" | Yes | The extension of the users-words word list file. If non-empty, it will attempt to load the relevant list of words to add to the dictionary for the selected language. Eg if set to ` user-words ` Tesseract will attempt to load ` eng.user-words ` from the tessdata directory at initialization time. |
| ` language_model_penalty_non_dict_word ` | double (0-1) | 0.15 | No | The penalty to apply to words not in the word\_dawg / user\_words wordlists. |
| ` language_model_penalty_non_freq_dict_word ` | double (0-1) | 0.1 | No | The penalty to apply to words not in the freq\_dawg wordlist. |

### Useful parameters for Japanese and Chinese ###

[Some Japanese tesseract user](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tesseract-ocr/A4IQlslY7hc/d4xK1PoihfMJ) found these parameters helpful for increasing tesseract-ocr (3.02) accuracy for Japanese :

| **Name** | **Suggested value** | **Description** |
|:---------|:--------------------|:----------------|
| chop\_enable | T | Chop enable. |
| use\_new\_state\_cost | F | Use new state cost heuristics for segmentation state evaluation |
| segment\_segcost\_rating | F | Incorporate segmentation cost in word rating? |
| enable\_new\_segsearch | 0 | Enable new segmentation search path. It could solve the problem of dividing one character to two characters |
| language\_model\_ngram\_on | 0 | Turn on/off the use of character ngram model. |
| textord\_force\_make\_prop\_words | F | Force proportional word segmentation on all rows. |
| edges\_max\_children\_per\_outline  | 40 | Max number of children inside a character outline. Increase this value if [some of KANJI characters are not recognized (rejected)](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/issues/detail?id=1022). |
